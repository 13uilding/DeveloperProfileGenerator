++++About++++
This application was designed to allow a user to create an HTML and PDF profile of  a GitHub user. The profile shows the GitHub user's avatar photo, their username, and links to their location (currently hardwired in for Denver), portfolio page, and GitHub page. The profile also shows the number of repositories, followers, following, and starred projects. The user also has the ability to select the color scheme of the generated website.
The entire HTML and PDF files are generated by Index.js. Index.js imports a function from generateHTML.js as well as other packages including Axios, HTML-PDF, and fs. Index.js utilizes async functions to wait for API calls before generating the website, so that all of the information is generated before creating the files.
